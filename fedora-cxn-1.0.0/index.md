For part three of our release parade, we're showcasing the 1.0.0 release of
[the FedoraConnector][plugin] plugin for [Omeka][omeka].

[Fedora Commons][fedora] is a digital repository management system. It's used
by libraries to manage and scale their online repository and digital assets and
collections. As such, it's often used by larger institutions; however, this
isn't aimed at those organizations. Instead, it's meant to be used by people
who wish to pull information from institutions that use Fedora Commons.

The FedoraConnector plugin doesn't help you discover resources in a repository.
But once you have the [PID][pid] for something that you'd like to include in an
Omeka site, you can use it to pull in the metadata for that item, as well as
any images or other content streams associated with it.

There is a little magic involved. You have to know the incantation to reach
your Fedora server and you have to know how to get the PIDs for the items
you're interested in. But [David McClure][clured] has worked hard to hammer out
an easy, fluid workflow for getting items from Fedora into Omeka.

And once you know these things, this plugin will allow you to pull content into
your Omeka site that you otherwise wouldn't have access to: things you've found
in your library catalogue and wished you could include, but didn't know how.

You can download the plugin on the [FedoraConnector plugin page][plugin]. The
code is on the [github repository][github]. If you have feedback, complaints,
or feature requests, visit the [issues page][issues]. And if you have any
questions, feel free to post to the [Omeka forums][forums].
